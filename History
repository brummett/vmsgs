# Revision History

# V 3.2.4 When entering a search term, accept things that look
#         like regexes with modifiers (like /Blah/i).  Save the
#         maxread id before running the selection widget with
#         search results, and restore that id after 3/29/06
# V 3.2.3 Partially fixed the handling of the up and down scroll
#         arrows for ScrollableWindow-s.  It's still not exactly
#         right, but it at least won't cur off the last character
#         in the read window with long lines like URLs  3/23/06
# V 3.2.2 Fixed a bug with rules file handling.  If a .msgsrules file 
#         existed at all, it would skip all msgs.  3/1/06
# V 3.2.1 PromptWindows with centered text should work properly now; it was
#         probably a cut-and-paste problem, but when figuring the starting
#         column, it was getting the length of $_ instead of $string in
#         ScrollableWindow->Draw().  Also, some terminals aren't capable
#         of hiding the cursor, and the new Drawing routine was putting
#         the cursor in an annoying position near the top of the Read widget.
#         I rearranged the order that things are drawn so the cursor ends up
#         at the bottom of the screen.  11/22/05
# V 3.2.0 Created a new class ScrollableWindow which
#         CursesInterface::PromptWindow and CI::Read inherit from.  
#         ScrollableWindow implements stuff like Draw() PageUp/Down and
#         LineUp/Down().   11/18/05
# V 3.1.2 After posting a new msg or a followup, there's a new option "E"
#         to re-edit your msg before posting.  Added "P" keypress on
#         the selection screen to jump to the parent, just like the
#         read widget  10/04/05
# V 3.1.1 Fixed tons of old and current bugs.  Added more key aliases to match
#         with mutt.  Stacking searches works.  P takes you to previous-in-
#         thread.  9/29/05
# V 3.1.0 Searching for one thing at a time is finally working 9/20/05
# V 3.0.2 Bunch of bugfixes so far after letting others play with it.  These
#         include: don't check executableness of $EDITOR or $MSGS_EDITOR,
#         since we didn't search the path, don't seperate the body from the
#         sig with --, ^L wasn't redrawing the screen, -k wasn't working,
#         etc.  See the vmsgs.mr up to today's date  7/10/02
# V 3.0.1 Good enough to say it's released.  All bugs from the Curses interface
#        are fixed (scroll-down-one bug in CursesInterface/Read.pm).  Text
#        interface rewritten to be widget-based and get rid of the now-unneeded 
#        TimerQueue and EventQueue 5/14/02
# V 3.0.0pre3 The "further back than 50" limitation is gone.  MsgList.pm
#        now is able to encode ranges without actually checking all the
#        msgIDs in the range until they're needed  2/7/02
# V 3.0.0pre2 Releasing for beta testing.  Msg.pm changed to return the
#        non standard headers, too (header) 11/29/01
# V 3.0.0pre1 All known bugs are fixed.  Search isn't implemented yet,
#        and there's still no way to view msgs further back then 50 before
#        the current one yet.  11/28/01
# V 3.0.0beta3 Changed over to a new MsgsList object implementation 11/27/01
# V 3.0.0beta2 Curses interface mostly working  11/20/01
# V 3.0.0beta1 Text interface functionality seems to be working fine
#        2/9/01
# V 2.99.0 Another complete rewrite.  Instead of one big spaghetti program
#        using msgs.pl, it's now broken up into logical modules.  One goal is
#        to have both a Curses and Tk interfaces (or mabye gtk or Qt instead)
#        1/25/01 still under development
#############################################################################
# V 2.98.1 vmsgs.debug files are now only created in the users home directory
#        (StartDebug) 9/28/00
# V 2.98 .msgsrand file is now supported for the "interesting" $0s (PickArgv0)
#        11/10/99
# V 2.97 Lines could get cut off if some lines in the post exceeded the
#        width of the terminal.  Now, it chops the lines up as it reads
#        them in to fit ther terminal's width (AsyncRead)  7/14/99
# V 2.96 Changed a bunch of stuff when we went to the new Lucien machine.
#        The main problem was that sigalrm-s weren't getting sent any more, so
#         looking for new messages is now done with polling  4/12/99
# V 2.95 Added "w" key for writing the current msg to a file (SelectMessage,
#        ReadMessage, WriteFile(new), GetHomeDir(new), DoHelp) 11/3/98
# V 2.94 Added scrolling msg display instead of redraw (ReadMessage,
#        GetCommandLine).  Added support for an rc file (.vmsgsrc) so you
#        don't have to remember all the command line switches (GetCommandLine)
#        Fixed getting the user and host names (main,PostMessage,Followup)
#        .msgsrc should now be correct after an abort with ^C (aaaaggghhhh,
#        InitMsgStat) 9/17/97
# V 2.93 Enabled use of the arrow keys - added a call to keypad() (main)
#        Created a wrapper for getch to handle reading from the child on
#        async reads - should fix random segfaults and bus errors (sigIO,
#        RealSigIO,GetAKey(new),InitMasterMsgHash).  Prints blank line for
#        non-existant msgs instead of barfing (PrintMsgInfoLine) 9/11/97
# V 2.92 Updated header parse function to look for non-whitespace chars
#        for the author instead of word characters (ParseHeader)
#        Spread out writes to the screen to look for segfaults
#        (PrintMsgsInfoLine) 9/9/97
# V 2.91 Reads from the server are now done with Async I/O (LoadHeader,
#        LoadBody, AsyncRead(new), sigIO(new)) 8/22/97
# V 2.90 Big rewrite to interface more smoothly with msgs.pl.  Headers and
#        bodies are now only read in when absolutely needed - should
#        speed up startup time.  Content-length: header now used properly.
#        Cheesy read ahead implimented - automaticly reads in three msgs.
#        8/18/97
###########################################################################
# V 2.33 Added -m command line option to start reading at a given msg #
#        (GetCommandLine, InitMsgStat).  If reading remotely, it only
#        loads 30 msgs prior to the current one instead of 100 for local
#        reading (InitMsgStat) 8/14/97
# V 2.32 Fixed a bug where a cached msg wasn't being used properly
#        (dreferencing a reference incorrectly) (Followup, MailReply) 8/5/97
# V 2.31 Help screen wasn't clearing the window before writing to it
#        (DoHelp).  Mail wasn't getting sent to the right address with remote
#        postings (MailReply).  Return email address wasn't always right
#        (PostMessage, Followup)  msgsrc is now centrally located.
#        InitMsgStat, aaaaggghhhh, main()) 7/30/97
# V 2.30 Support for remote msg reading.  Lots of new stuff rewritten to
#        use the msgsd API (msgsd.pl)  (FirstMessage, NumMessages,
#        CreateMsgsArray, ReadMessage, PostMessage, Followup, MailReply,
#        sigalrm, ShouldKillfile).  Msgs can be cached (CreateMsgsArray,
#        ReadMessage, Followup, sigalrm) 7/29/97
# V 2.20 Messages are now seperated by 1000s (/var/msgs/13000.dir).
#        (CreateMsgsArray, PostMessage, Followup, ReadMessage, IncBoundsFile,
#        sigalrm, ShouldKillFile, SearchMessages, GetMsgDir2(new)).
#        Temoprary messages are now stored in the user's home directory
#        instead of /tmp (PostMessage, Followup).  Now you can mail a reply
#        to someone's message (SelectMessage, ReadMessage, MailReply(new)).
#        4/29/97
# V 2.12 If you put in a blank subject in a new message, it'll ask if you
#        want to forget the message, like in elm. (PostMessage)  3/12/97
# V 2.11 Make it so the sig is added before it fires up the editor
#        (PostMessage, Followup)   3/6/97
# V 2.1  Added support for a .msgssig file (PostMessage, Followup,
#        AppendSig(new)).  Preliminary work started on threading during read
#        mode
# V 2.00 Added 2 columns to the display so there's room for 5-digit msg IDs
#        (PrintMsgInfoLine).  New msg notification now works correctly
#        (sigalrm).
# V 1.95 Fixed an oversight where it'd get into an endless loop if you killfile
#        everything (main()). Added -k flag to ignore the kill file
#        (GetCommandLine, ReadKillfile).  Dosen't core dump when you ^C
#        (aaaaggghhhh).  Fixed the segfault returning from search mode -
#        forgot a local() (SearchMessages).  Message count on the title
#        bar is now always correct (SelectMessage).  Did an audit of calls
#        to refresh(), touchwin() and clear() to try and get rid of some
#        of the redraws - it didn't help much.
# V 1.94 Made the changes to kill files (.msgskill) so it works right. Added
#        uid kills (ShouldKillfile, CreateMsgsArray, main(), ReadKillfile)
# V 1.93 Added the -all flag (it'll only read 100 messages prior to the
#        current message, unless you give it -all. This will speed up startup
#        time). Added a umask call so msgs are set world-readable (main(),.
#        InitMsgsStat)
# V 1.92 Fixed a bug where newly arrived messages' dates and lengths were not
#        parsed correctly (sigalrm). Messages with no body are now handled
#        correctly (ReadMessage).
# V 1.91 Selection screen now scrolled instead of redrawn (SelectMessage).
#        Support for recognizing pre-posted messages (IncBoundsFile). Quicker
#        updates of newly arrived messages (now reads only new messages,
#        instead of all of them) (sigalrm).
# V 1.90 Complete rewrite. Changed over to curses stuff. Added searching,
#        killfiles. Info about messages is now stored in a hash (to reduce
#        disk I/O while running) and passed around by a reference to that
#        hash.
#############################################################################
# V 1.03 Fixed a bug in DrawScreen that wouldn't print the name or date
#        correctly if the message was posted between midnight and noon
#        (single digit hours). Also, it won't make the subject full of
#        Re:'s on a reply  9/23/96
# V 1.02 Moved around the calls to stty so it dosen't need to be run as often.
#        Added signal handler for SIGcont.
# V 1.01 Changed GetAChar so it dosen't echo the character you get.
#        Added some keypress aliases. Added signal handlers.  8/30/96
# V 1.00 Original release.  8/29/96
