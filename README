vmsgs - A redesign of an improvement for a drop-in replacement for the old
Sequent UNIX msgs tool

In the late summer of 1996, a conferencing system called msgs (pronounced
"messages") was developed on a privately owned Linux computer system on the
Internet.  It's like usenet with only one newsgroup, or an email box where
everyone sees the same messages.  In the 13 years it's been around, there 
have been almost three quarters of a million messages posted.

The original msgs tool is a simple text console app with basic reading and
posting abilities.  vmsgs aimed to replace it with a full-screen curses-based
application.  It's development started in August of 1996, though no new
development since 2006.  It is still used every day.

vmsgs is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
msgs.pl is support code, primarily from Kees Cook.
